(Description)
Our MilkWeights program interacts with the user to prompt what kind of report the user desires. Once selected, depending on the report type, the user will be prompted for more specific information to display. There are buttons included to show instructions, write an output file, and to close the program. The add, edit, remove, and display buttons do not accurately perform computations yet and are included solely for show. This will all be achieved through JavaFX.
